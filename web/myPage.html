<article> 
<p id="p1">
	I am from Ukraine, Kiev. My name is Max Gerasymenko<br>
	I have been married about 2 years and I have a little boy. <br>
	His name is Derek and he is almost one month old. He cries a lot so far<br>
	My wife, Lena, is from Orlando, Florida. She graduated BYU Provo last year.<br>
	She likes reading books. One of her favourite present is a good book.<br>
	I served my mission in Russia, Samara. I have been a member of the church since 6<br>years old. I have a younger sister. She is studying at UVU in Orem, Utah.<br>
	I am studying software engineering. I enjoy coding. Steve Jobs: “Everybody<br> 
	should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think”<br>
